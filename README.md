Assignment 1 - Reversible Prime Squares

Theoretical Background

Both 169 and 961 are the square of a prime. 
169 is the reverse of 961. 
We call a number a reversible prime square if: 
• It is not a palindrome, and
•It is the square of a prime, and Its reverse
 is also the square of a prime. 

Develop a program that determines and prints the 
first 10 reversible prime squares. 
The assignment has three main parts:

Develop a high-level implementation of the program in C
Implement a MIPS assembly equivalent of the program
Generate a hexadecimal coded machine code equivalent of the program
